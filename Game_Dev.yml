- - What is Intro to Game Development about?
  - We will cover the fundamentals of code and art needed to build a game. Our tool of choice will be the Unity Engine, a professional tool for building 3D Games.
- - What is Intermediate Game Development about?
  - Developers will work to learn basic concepts and skills as they build out their own personal "utility belt" of projects. Using the broad range of topics we will go over, by the end not only will the student have a good start to their portfolio, but scripts and scenes they can re-use in later projects they might work on.
- - What is Advanced Game Development about?
  - Developers will work in a small-scale studio setting, collectively pitch ideas for a game to develop, and proceed to work together to develop that game.
- - What language(s) does Game Development use?
  - The programming language used in Game Development is C#.
- - What platform does Game Development use?
  - Game Development uses the platform Unity.
